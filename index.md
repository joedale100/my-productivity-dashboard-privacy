# Privacy Policy

## My Productivity Dashboard

My Productivity Dashboard does not collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal data.

All data created by the user, including buttons, notes, lists, colour choices, and settings, is stored locally in the users browser using Chrome storage. This data never leaves the users device.

The extension does not use analytics, tracking technologies, cookies, or third party services.

The extension does not communicate with any external servers.

If the extension is removed from Chrome, all locally stored data is removed with it.
